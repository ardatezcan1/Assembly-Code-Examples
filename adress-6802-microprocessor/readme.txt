Out of 50 unsigned 16-bit numbers placed in the memory starting from address F300H, 
find the ones with 4444H values and design the program that stores how many of them at address 41H, 
by drawing the flow diagram and briefly explain the working principle. Write the program in the language of the 6802 microprocessor, 
in the form of an converter source file, with all the necessary descriptions and an explanation of the instruction in each line.

FOR FLOWCHART

A: 1. The F300 address is loaded into the X register. 2. The value 44H is loaded into register A 3. Address 41H is reset.
B: A 16-bit number cannot be kept in one address, since a single address is 8-bit, it can be kept in two addresses. At this stage, it is checked whether the value kept in the first address part is equal to the value 44H. 
C: If the first 8-bit is equal, the value held at the next address is checked to see if it is equal to 44H.
D: If the number is equal to 4444H, the value of address 41H is increased by 1. 
E: The address held in the X register is incremented 2 times to move to the next number.
F: In order to hold 50 16-bit numbers, 1 address can hold 8-bit data in the simulation model used, 100 8-bit numbers are required. If we convert 100 to the hexadecimal system, it equals 64H. So our final address would be F364H. At this stage, it is checked whether the address held in the X register is equal to F364H. 
G: If the result is even, the value held at address 41H is loaded into register A.
